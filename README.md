### 🔹 **1x3 Router Design** *(Jan 2025 – May 2025)*  
- Designed and implemented a **1x3 router** in Verilog for efficient data routing.  
- Integrated **FSM**, **FIFO buffers**, **synchronizers**, and **registers** to manage data flow.  
- Synthesized RTL using *Synopsys Design Compiler* and validated code quality with *SpyGlass linting*.  

---

### 🔹 **Automated Washing Machine Controller** *(Jan 2024 – May 2024)*  
- Developed an **FSM-based controller** supporting multiple load modes and timed operations.  
- Implemented **safety logic** for soak, wash, rinse, and spin cycles.  
- Verified design functionality through **RTL simulation and synthesis** with *Synopsys tools*.  

---

### 🔹 **Verification of Modulo-12 Loadable Up-Down Counter** *(Aug 2023 – Dec 2023)*  
- Built a **class-based UVM-style testbench** for functional verification.  
- Implemented **interface, driver, monitor, and transaction classes**.  
- Applied **functional coverage** and **constrained-random testing** to ensure design robustness.
